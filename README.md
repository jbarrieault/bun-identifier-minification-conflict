# Bun Identifier Minification Collisions

`Bun.build({ minify: false })` produces output with identifier collisions that error when parsed at runtime:

```Type d is not a function```

Specifically, the issue occurs when setting `minify` with `identifiers: false`. The other `minify` properties can be disabled just fine. Turning _on_ identifier minifcation resolves the issue.

I've reproduced on Bun 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.4.

# Steps to Reproduce
Non-bundled, works:
```
bun index.js
```

Bundled, errors:
```
bun ./dist/index.js
```

Or using your browser's JS runtime:
- `bun ./index.unbundled.html`
- `bun ./index.bundled.html`

# Observations
The bundle, `dist/index.js` has a flattened scopeâ€”identifiers from all imported module files live at the top-level. Perhaps that's a strategy Bun has good reason for. But it appears `foo.js`'s `var d` [promotion](https://github.com/jbarrieault/bun-identifier-minification-conflict/blob/main/dist/index.js#L14) to the top-level scope is not noticed when transforming `bar.js`. Thus, the resulting identifier collision.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
